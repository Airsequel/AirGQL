{-| Each table, say `foo`, generates a `foo` and a `foo_by_pk` query. If a
table named `foo_by_pk` exists, this introduces a naming conflict.
This issue also occurs in a few other places (like argument naming).

To solve this, we implement the `encodeOutsideList` function, which encodes a
name such that it does not conflict with any other name inside a given list.
This is done by repeatedly appending _ to the name until it does not reside
inside the given list anymore.
